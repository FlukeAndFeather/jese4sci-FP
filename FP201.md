# FP201: Acquire data

Now that you've chosen the study you would like to replicate, you will need to find the data that underlies the study's results. 

These days, at least some of the data used to publish a result will be made accessible upon publication.Data availability statements have become increasingly popular and often required by journals. Many journals, such as Current Biology, have open data requirements, with a special section dedicated to reporting resources, data, and tools used. A good first step is to find the data availability section in the paper.

This section will look different in papers published in different journals, but will have similar components. Data may be provided through different data repositories, such as Dryad, figshare, NCBI SRA, or may be provided directly as csv files or zipped folders. You may also find a GitHub repository containing the code and protocols used to analyze the data. 

Though there is a general shift towards making relevant data and code available upon publication, it is not uncommon to find data availability statements that read "Data available upon request". This requires reaching out to the corresponding author, which may or may not be enough to receive the data in a timely manner. For the purposes of this assignment, we have selected example papers which make their data publicly accessible.
